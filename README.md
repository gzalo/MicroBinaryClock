# Micro Binary Clock

Minimalistic Binary Clock using a PIC16F628a.

Uses 4 bits for the hour (0-12), 6 bits for the minutes (0-59), so it can be shown with a 10 segment LED bar.
Single button to change hours/minutes. Short presses increase the minute counter, long presses increment the hour counter.
